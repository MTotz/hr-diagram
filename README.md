## My attempt at a Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram

This was done purely for fun to see if the data I have would reproduce an accurate Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram.

## To-do

1. Change data to one that is publicly accessible and documented.
2. Color data points according to color index.
3. Plot a third axis of distance to make a 3D plot. Could be interesting to see the distribution of color vs. luminosity vs. distance from Earth.
